# second-maven-project

This repository demonstrates the creation of a multi-module web application with three main modules:

1. **Data Model:** Contains data-related classes and structures.
2. **Business Logic:** Implements the core application logic.
3. **Presentation:** Manages the user interface and presentation layer.

### Setting up Tomcat

1. Configure Tomcat 10 through IntelliJ IDEA or by adding a configuration to the Maven plugin.

2. Ensure that Tomcat is properly set up, as it's required to run the web application.

### Parent POM Configuration

In this project, we have adopted a modular approach for managing dependencies and plugins using a parent POM (Project Object Model).

1. **dependencyManagement Section:**

   - The `dependencyManagement` section in the parent POM centralizes the version management of project dependencies.

2. **pluginManagement Section:**

   - The `pluginManagement` section in the parent POM centralizes the configuration of Maven plugins.
